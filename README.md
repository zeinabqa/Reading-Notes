# GitHub Pages
**GitHub Pages are public webpages hosted and easily published through GitHub. The quickest way to get up and running is by using the Jekyll Theme Chooser to load a pre-made theme. You can then modify your GitHub Pages‚Äô content and style remotely via the web or locally on your computer.**

## Create Your Website
- Once you‚Äôve signed in, you‚Äôll create a new repository to get started.

- On the new repository screen, you need to give this repository a special name to generate your website.
![Repo name](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/create-new-repo-screen.png)
- Your website‚Äôs files will live in a repository named **username.github.io** (where ‚Äúusername‚Äù is your actual GitHub user name). To begin setting up your site, you have to open the Settings tab
![settings](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/repo-settings.png)
- If you scroll down on the settings page, you‚Äôll see the **GitHub Pages** section near the bottom. Click the **Choose a theme** button to start the process of creating your site.
![theme](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/launch-theme-chooser.png)
- Once you‚Äôve clicked the button, you‚Äôll be directed to the Theme Chooser. You‚Äôll see several theme options in a carousel across the top of the page. Click on the images to preview the themes. Once you‚Äôve selected one, click **Select theme** on the right to move on. It‚Äôs easy to change your theme later, so if you‚Äôre not sure, just choose one for now.

- Here‚Äôs where you‚Äôll write your own content (You can keep the default content for now, if you‚Äôd like).

- Once you‚Äôre finished editing, scroll down to the bottom of the page and click **Commit changes**.
![Commit changes](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/commit-edits.png)
- GitHub does all the work to direct visitors to username.github.io to view your new website. This can take up to 10 minutes. After some time has passed, you can open a new tab in your browser to go to your site!
