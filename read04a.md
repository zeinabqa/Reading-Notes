## Programming with JavaScript

JavaScript can be used in browsers to make websites more interactive, interesting, and user-friendly. Its enough for the user is to know how to build web pages using HTML and CSS

Learning programing with JavaScript involves:-
Basic programming concepts.
like all languages, you need to know its vocabulary and how to structure your sentences.
How it applied.
Clarification:-
Introduction pages come at the beginning of each chapter. They introduce the key topics you will learn about.
Reference pages introduce key pieces of JavaScript. HTML code is shown in blue, CSS code in pink, and JavaScript in green.
Background pages appear on white. They explain the context of the topics covered that are discussed in each chapter.
Diagram and infographics pages are shown on a dark background. They provide a simple, visual reference to topics discussed.

The ABC of programming:
Before you learn how to read and write the JavaScript language itself, you need to become familiar with some key concepts in computer programming. They will be covered in three sections:

A) What is a script and how it can be created ? B) How dose the computer fits with the word around them ? C) How do user write a script for a webpage ?

What is a script?
A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.

You could compare scripts to any of the following:
Recipe: Some scripts are simple and only deal with one individual scenario, like a simple recipe for a basic dish. Other scripts can perform many tasks, like a recipe for a complicated three-course meal

HandBooks: In a complex script, the browser might use only a subset of the code available at any given time.

Manual: Scripts can allow the browser to check the current situation and only perform a set of steps if that action is appropriate.

WRITING A SCRIPT
To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it.

Define the goal : First, you need to define the task you want to achieve. You can think of this as a puzzle for 1. the computer to solve.
2. Design the script.
3. Code each step.
