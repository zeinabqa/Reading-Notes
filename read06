##JAVASCRIPT & JQUERY##
*how jave script makes web bages more intractive 
1-ACCESS CONTENT
You can use JavaScript to select any
element, attribute, or text from an
HTML page. For example:
• Select the text inside all of the <hl>
elements on a page
• Select any elements that have a
c 1 ass attribute with a value of note
• Find out what was entered into a
text input whose id attribute has a
value of ema i 1
2
MODIFY CONTENT
You can use JavaScript to add
elements, attributes, and text to the
page, or remove them. For example:
• Add a paragraph of text after the
first <hl> element
• Change the value of c 1 ass
attributes to trigger new CSS rules
for those elements
• Change the size or position of an
<i mg> element
3
PROGRAM RULES
You can specify a set of steps for
the browser to follow (like a recipe),
which allows it to access or change the
content of a page. For example:
• A gallery script could check which
image a user clicked on and display
a larger version of that image.
• A mortgage calculator could collect
values from a form, perform a
ca lculation, and display repayments.
• An animation could check the
dimensions of the browser window
and move an image to the bottom
of the viewable area (also known as
the viewport).

REACT TO EVENTS
You can specify that a script should run
when a specific event has occurred. For
example, it could be run when:
• A button is pressed
• A link is clicked (or tapped) on
• A cursor hovers over an element
• Information is added to a form
• An interval of time has passed
• A web page has finished loading
OPERATORS
Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to
create a single value from one or more values.
Covered in this chapter:
ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS
Assign a value to a variable
color = 'beige';
The value of co 1 or is now beige.
(See p61)
ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
Perform basic math
area = 3 * 2;
The value of area is now 6.

STRING OPERATORS
Combine two strings
greeting= 'Hi 1 + 'Mol ly';
The value of greeting is now Hi Molly.

Covered in Chapter 4:
COMPARISON OPERATORS
Compare two values and return true or fa 1 se
buy = 3 > 5;
The value of buy is fa 1 se.
(See p150)
LOGICAL OPERATORS
Combine expressions and return true or fa 1 se
buy= (5 > 3) && (2 < 4);
The value of buy is now true
ARITHMETI C OPERATORS
JavaScript contains the following mathematical
operators, which you can use with numbers.
You may remember some from math class.
NAME OPERATOR PURPOSE & NOTES
ADDITION + Adds one value to another
SUBTRACTION Subtracts one value from another
DIVISION I Divides two values
EXAMPLE RESULT
10 + 5 15
10 - 5 5
10 I 5 2
MULTIPLICATION * Multiplies two values using an asterisk
(Note that this is not the letter x) 10 * 5 50
INCREMENT + + Adds one to the current number i = 10; 11 . i++; . . . ... ······-······ ........... ... ....................................... .. ... . ................................................................................... .
DECREMENT
MODULUS %
ORDER OF EXECUTION
Several arithmetic operations
can be performed in one
expression, but it is important
to understand how the result
will be calculated. Multiplication
and division are performed
before addition or subtraction.
This can affect the number that
you expect to see. To illustrate
this effect, look at the following
examples.
G BASIC JAVASCRIPT INSTRUCTIONS
i--; Subtracts one from the current number i = 10; 9
Divides two values and returns the
remainder
Here the numbers are calculated
left to right, so the total is 16:
total = 2 + 4 + 10;
But in the following.example the
total is 42 (not 60):
total = 2 + 4 * 10;
This is because multiplication
and division happen before
addition and subtraction.
10 % 3 1
To change the order in which
operations are performed, place
the calculation you want done
first inside parentheses. So for
the following, the total is 60:
total = (2 + 4) * 10;
The parentheses indicate that
the 2 is added to the 4, and then
the resulting figure is multiplied
by10.
WHAT IS A FUNCTION?
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements)
