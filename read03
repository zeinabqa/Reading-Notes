*In this chapter, we will focus on some helpful topics that are
not easily grouped together. You will learn about:*

1. The different versions of HTML and how to indicate which version you are using

2. How to add comments to your code

3. Global attributes, which are attributes that can be used on any element, including the class and id attributes

4. Elements that are used to group together parts of the page where no other element is suitable

5. How to embed a page within a page using iframes

6. How to add information about the web page using the <meta> element

7. Adding characters such as angled brackets and copyright symbols

## The Evolution of HT ML

### HTML 4

### HTML 1.0

### HTML 5

## DOC Types

*Because there have been
several versions of HTML, each
web page should begin with a
DOCTYPE declaration to tell a
browser which version of HTML
the page is using (although
browsers usually display the
page even if it is not included).
We will therefore be including
one in each example for the rest
of the book.*

## Comments in HTML

*If you want to add a comment
to your code that will not be
visible in the user's browser, you
can add the text between these
characters.
It is a good idea to add
comments to your code because,
no matter how familiar you
are with the page at the time
of writing it, when you come
back to it later (or if someone
else needs to look at the code),
comments will make it much
easier to understand.*

## ID Attribute

*Every HTML element can carry
the id attribute. It is used to
uniquely identify that element
from other elements on the
page. Its value should start with
a letter or an underscore (not a
number or any other character).
It is important that no two
elements on the same page
have the same value for their id
attributes (otherwise the value is
no longer unique).
As you will see when you
come to look at CSS in the next
section, giving an element a
unique identity allows you to
style it differently than any other
instance of the same element
on the page. For example,
you might want to assign one
paragraph within the page
(perhaps a paragraph containing
a pull quote) a different style
than all of the other paragraphs.
In the example on the right, the
paragraph with the id attribute
whose value is pullquote is
made uppercase using CSS.*

## Class Attribute

*Every HTML element can
also carry a class attribute.
Sometimes, rather than uniquely
identifying one element within
a document, you will want a
way to identify several elements
as being different from the
other elements on the page.
For example, you might have
some paragraphs of text that
contain information that is more
important than others and want
to distinguish these elements, or
you might want to differentiate
between links that point to other
pages on your own site and links
that point to external sites.*

## Block Elements

*Some elements will always
appear to start on a new line in
the browser window. These are
known as block level elements.*

## Inline Elements

*Some elements will always
appear to continue on the
same line as their neighbouring
elements. These are known as
inline elements.*

## Grouping Text & Elements In a Block

*The <div> element allows you to
group a set of elements together
in one block-level box.
For example, you might create
a <div> element to contain all
of the elements for the header
of your site (the logo and the
navigation), or you might create
a <div> element to contain
comments from visitors.
In a browser, the contents of
the <div> element will start on
a new line, but other than this
it will make no difference to the
presentation of the page.*
  
  ## HTML5 Layout Ch17
  
  *They are covered here (rather than with the other HTML
elements you met earlier in the book) because you'll find
it easier to understand how they can be used now that you
have seen how CSS can control the layout a page. These
new elements are going to play an important part in creating
layouts going forward. In this chapter you will see:*

1. The new HTML5 layout elements and their uses
2. How they offer helpful alternatives to the <div> element
3. How to ensure older browsers recognize these elements

## Process & Design Ch18

*In this chapter, we will focus on some helpful topics that are
not easily grouped together. You will learn about:*

1. How to approach building a site
2. Understanding your audience and their needs
3. How to present information visitors want to see

## What Your Visitors are Trying to Achieve

### Gordon

*Bought a tennis racquet several years ago; now he wants to purchase one from your site for his girlfriend.*

### Molly

*has read about your new doggy daycare service in the press and
wants to find out whether it would be suitable for her to use.*

### Jasper

*had a bad experience staying in a hotel when visiting Sydney,
Australia, and wants to make a complaint.*

### Ayo

*hopes to study architecture and wants to learn more about a new
course that is being offered.*

### Ivy

*is a picture editor and wants to look at a photographer's site to see## examples of his work before deciding whether to commission him.*

## Site Maps

*The aim is to create a diagram
of the pages that will be used
to structure the site. This is
known as a site map and it will
show how those pages can be
grouped.
To help you decide what
information should go on each
page, you can use a technique
called card sorting.
This involves placing each
piece of information that a
visitor might need to know on
a separate piece of paper and
then organizing the related
information into groups.
